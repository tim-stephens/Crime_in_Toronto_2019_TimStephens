# Crime_in_Toronto_2019_TimStephens
An investigation of the relationship between crime and population in 140 Toronto neighbourhoods.


This analysis was performed in order to determine if one Toronto neighbourhood 
was safer than others. After comparing crime rates of different neighbourhoods,
it was found that the proportion of people committing crimes was similar across 
all neighbourhoods - one area of Toronto is not "safer" than another.
